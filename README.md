Objective:

The objectives of this project is to analyze the frequency, severity, and impact of natural disasters globally in 2024, with a focus on understanding the economic losses, fatalities, and regional distribution of disasters. The project aims to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for disaster mitigation and preparedness.

Methodology:

1.     Data Collection and Preparation:

·         The dataset included information on disaster type, affected regions, fatalities, economic losses, and magnitudes.

·         Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

2.      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

·         Conducted a detailed analysis of disaster occurrence, categorizing by type (earthquakes, floods, wildfires, Hurricane).

·         Used visualizations like Line Chart for time Trend, Treemaps, bar charts, and Donut Chats to identify regional trends.

3.      Statistical Analysis:

·         Measured correlations between disaster type, magnitude, and economic loss

4.      Insights Extraction:

·         Highlighted key findings related to disaster frequency and severity.

 

KEY INSIGHTS:

1.The total economic loss recorded globally from disasters during the specified periods is $5.05 trillion.

2.The United States recorded the highest economic loss by location, totaling $0.85 trillion.

3.Floods caused the highest economic loss among disaster types.

4.The total recorded fatalities from disasters worldwide reached 50 million.

5.Earthquakes were the most frequent disaster type, with an average magnitude of 11.39 and a total fatality count of 10.1 million.

6.India experienced the highest number of fatalities, accounting for over 25% of the total.

7.Japan recorded one of the lowest fatality rates, with fatalities making up approximately 27% of those affected.

8.A total of six countries were significantly affected by natural disasters in 2024.

9.January recorded the highest number of fatalities over time, with a total of 7.3 million.

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.Government should increase preparedness in areas such as India  with high fatality rates by enhancing early warning systems, conducting community education on safety protocols, and establishing rapid response units.

2.Government should prioritize reinforcement of infrastructure in frequently affected areas to reduce future economic losses and mitigate fatalities.

3.Government should direct more resources to regions frequently affected by high-magnitude disasters such as  earthquakes and flood to ensure adequate emergency supplies, shelters, and medical facilities.

4.For disaster types with high economic loss like floods, government should invest in preventive measures (e.g., flood defenses) to reduce future expenses.

5.There should be provision of affordable insurance models for individuals in high-risk areas to cover potential economic losses.

6.Government should implement policies or official rules and regulations that require buildings to be constructed with materials and techniques that make them more durable and able to withstand various environmental stresses, like earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfire, or floods. By establishing these resilient building standards, structures would be better equipped to endure natural disasters, helping to reduce damage, save lives, and lower recovery costs.

7.In locations with frequent or high-fatality disasters, government should upgrade monitoring systems to detect high-magnitude disasters earlier.
